---

## Overview
The "Predict Household Item Prices" project is focused on forecasting the cost of household items based on features such as category, size, brand, and more. This predictive tool helps consumers make cost-effective choices while shopping and assists businesses in pricing their products competitively.

Key features:
- Regression models to predict item prices.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure robust predictions.
- Analysis of the impact of features like brand, size, and category on pricing.


---

## Motivation
With the vast number of household items available in the market, understanding pricing trends can benefit both consumers and businesses. This project uses data-driven insights to predict item prices, enabling cost optimization and improved purchasing decisions.

# Technical Aspect
**Data Handling:**
- **Data Collection:** Includes features like item category, size, brand, material, and average market price.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values and outliers.
  - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., brand, category).
  - Scaling numerical features to improve model accuracy.

**Model Training:**
- **Algorithm:** 
  - Linear Regression for price prediction.
  - Ridge and Lasso Regression to manage overfitting.
  - Polynomial Regression for capturing non-linear relationships.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - GridSearchCV for parameter optimization.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
- Residual analysis to ensure the reliability of predictions.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

# To clone the repository

```bash

gh repo clone Creator-Turbo/ML-ALL-projects

```


## To Do

Build a web application using Flask to deploy the prediction model.

Implement advanced visualization for medical data analysis.

Set up monitoring and logging for model predictions.
