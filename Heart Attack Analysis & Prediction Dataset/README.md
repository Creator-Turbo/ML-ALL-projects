## Overview
The Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical attributes. By analyzing features like cholesterol level, age, blood pressure, and other clinical data, this model aims to assist in early detection and preventative healthcare.

Key features:

Comprehensive data preprocessing for accurate predictions.

Training models using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

Exploration of the most influential medical factors contributing to heart attack risk.

## Motivation
Heart diseases are among the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction and timely intervention can save countless lives. This project aims to provide healthcare professionals and individuals with a reliable tool for assessing heart attack risk, thereby promoting early detection and prevention.

# Technical Aspect
Data Handling:

Data Collection: Includes medical features such as cholesterol level, blood pressure, and age.

Preprocessing:

Handling missing or inconsistent data.

Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender).

Scaling numerical features for optimal model performance.

Model Training:

Algorithms:

Logistic Regression for baseline predictions.

Random Forest for robust classification and feature importance.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.

Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

Feature importance analysis to identify key medical factors.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

# To clone the repository

```bash

gh repo clone Creator-Turbo/ML-ALL-projects

```


## To Do

Build a web application using Flask to deploy the prediction model.

Implement advanced visualization for medical data analysis.

Set up monitoring and logging for model predictions.

Integrate additional medical features for enhanced accuracy.

Automate model retraining with new data.

Develop an end-to-end pipeline for real-time predictions.
