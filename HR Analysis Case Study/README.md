---

## Overview
The HR Analysis Case Study leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and trends in employee performance, retention, and other critical factors affecting human resource operations. This project aims to support HR teams in making data-driven decisions to enhance workforce management and productivity.

Key features:
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) for deriving actionable insights.
- Use of machine learning models to predict key HR metrics.
- Identification of factors influencing employee retention and performance.



---

## Motivation
Effective HR management is critical for the success of any organization. Understanding the factors affecting employee satisfaction, retention, and performance can help businesses maintain a productive workforce and reduce turnover costs. This project aims to provide HR professionals with the tools and insights needed for strategic decision-making.

## Technical Aspect
**Data Handling:**
- **Data Collection:** Includes features like employee performance ratings, tenure, department, salary, and retention status.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing or inconsistent data.
  - Encoding categorical variables such as job roles and departments.
  - Normalizing numerical features for improved model accuracy.

**Model Training:**
- **Algorithms:**
  - Decision Trees for interpretable insights.
  - Logistic Regression for binary classification tasks.
  - Gradient Boosting models for predictive accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
- Feature importance analysis to determine key drivers of HR metrics.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

# To clone the repository

```bash

gh repo clone Creator-Turbo/ML-ALL-projects

```


## To Do

Build a web application using Flask to deploy the prediction model.

Implement advanced visualization for medical data analysis.

Set up monitoring and logging for model predictions.

Integrate additional medical features for enhanced accuracy.

Automate model retraining with new data.

Develop an end-to-end pipeline for real-time predictions.
