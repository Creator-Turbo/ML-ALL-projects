---

## Overview
The Online Food Delivery Prediction project utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a customer ordering food online. By analyzing features such as time of day, location, order frequency, and customer preferences, this project aims to help food delivery platforms improve their marketing strategies and operational efficiency.

Key features:
- Use of classification models to predict customer ordering behavior.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for robust predictions.
- Analysis of key factors influencing online food orders.

---

## Motivation
Online food delivery services have revolutionized how people order food. Understanding customer behavior can help delivery platforms better target their audience, optimize resources, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project provides a predictive tool to assist in these efforts.

# Technical Aspect
**Data Handling:**
- **Data Collection:** Includes features like time of day, customer location, past order history, and promotional activity.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values and outliers.
  - Encoding categorical variables such as customer location and meal type.
  - Scaling numerical features for improved model performance.

**Model Training:**
- **Algorithms:**
  - Logistic Regression for baseline classification.
  - Decision Trees and Random Forests for capturing complex patterns.
  - Gradient Boosting models for enhanced predictive accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
- Analysis of feature importance to identify key predictors of ordering behavior.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

# To clone the repository

```bash

gh repo clone Creator-Turbo/ML-ALL-projects

```


## To Do

Build a web application using Flask to deploy the prediction model.
