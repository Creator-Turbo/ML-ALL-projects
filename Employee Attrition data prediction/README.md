## Overview
The Employee Attrition Prediction project uses machine learning models to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. By analyzing historical data, the model aims to help businesses identify employees at risk of attrition and take proactive measures to improve retention.

Key features:

Comprehensive data preprocessing for reliable predictions.
Training models such as Random Forest and Decision Trees for accuracy.
Insights into factors contributing to employee attrition.



---

## Motivation
Employee retention is a critical aspect of business success. High attrition rates can lead to increased recruitment costs and loss of organizational knowledge. This project aims to assist companies in understanding and addressing employee attrition to build a more stable workforce.

---

## Technical Aspect
Training Machine Learning Models:

- Data Collection: Employee-related data, including demographic details, performance metrics, job satisfaction, and tenure.

Preprocessing:

- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.
- Scaling numerical features for consistency.

Model Training:

- Algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Trees.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation:

- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
Feature importance analysis to understand key attrition factors.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

# To clone the repository

```bash

gh repo clone Creator-Turbo/ML-ALL-projects

```


## To Do
